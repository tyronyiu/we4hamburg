                Hygiene & protective equipment required to operate nowadays is
                hard to get hands on. Uncertain and long deliveries, export
                restrictions, shortages and unprepared governments needing
                supplies as well, make it very hard for a small business to
                start operating again. How is a small caf√© going to source face
                shields or a desperately needed hairdresser face-masks?

                Natural expertise from members and the support of the community
                enable mass relief action. Local communities must come together
                and collaborate in overcoming a common hurdle, often not only
                for improved performance, but necessity. Local economic activity
                is required for this period of stagnation for small businesses
                to survive.
                Aggregating demand, this sourcing and funding as a collective is
                the best way of ensuring scalable continuous operations.

                The closeness a business has with its customers and thus the
                underlying support for that local brand is diminishing with
                geographical distance for most small businesses. Thus, it makes
                sense to reach out to your surroundings for support and
                collaboration. Locally unmet needs can then be addressed
                top-down from super-communities.
