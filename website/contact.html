            You may ask
            yourself what a collaborative business platform is and that's
            absolutely expected, because this is a first of a kind. The central
            thought behind We4Hamburg is that businesses help each other out in common
            problems.

                    The premise:<br/>
            <em>
                    "Many businesses have common problems right now or encounter
                    those that others have already experienced and know how
                    to handle."

                </b>
            <br /><br />
            That could mean sourcing from each other, funding each others'
            initiatives, or sharing insights and networking connections. <br />
            Specific offers and benefits depend on what is being offered and
            contributed by the group.

            Hygiene & protective equipment required to operate is
            hard to get hands on nowadays. Uncertain and long deliveries, export
            restrictions, shortages and unprepared governments needing
            supplies as well, make it very hard for a small business to
            start operating again. How is a small caf√© going to source face
            shields or a hairdresser desperately needed face-masks?

            Natural expertise from members and the support of the community
            enable mass relief action. Local communities must come together
            and collaborate in overcoming a common hurdle, often not only
            for improved performance, but necessity. Local economic activity
            is required for this period of stagnation for small businesses
            to survive.
            Aggregating demand, this sourcing and funding as a collective is
            the best way of ensuring scalable continuous operations.

            businesses to open doors asap again for operations, with minimal

            The closeness a business has with its customers and thus the
            underlying support for that local brand is diminishing with
            geographical distance for most small businesses. Thus, it makes
            sense to reach out to your surroundings for support and
            collaboration. Locally unmet needs can then be addressed
            top-down from super-communities.

            on national scale.
